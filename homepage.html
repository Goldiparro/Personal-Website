                    <h2> <b> GOLDI ADRIENNE PARRO </b></h2>
                <p> Hello! I'm Goldi Adrienne L. Parro, a passionate Computer Science student at ACLC College of Iriga. With a keen interest in all things tech, I am dedicated to mastering the intricacies of computer science and exploring the endless possibilities it offers.</p> <br>
                    <p> In addition to my academic pursuits, I have a deep-seated love for online gaming. This hobby not only entertains me but also hones my strategic thinking and problem-solving abilities. When I'm not immersed in the digital world, you'll often find me in the kitchen, experimenting with new recipes and perfecting my culinary skills. Cooking is a creative outlet that brings me immense joy and satisfaction.<br>
                    <p> As a self-proclaimed homebody, I find comfort and inspiration in my own space, which allows me to focus on my studies and personal interests. This lifestyle has fostered a sense of discipline and balance, helping me to excel both academically and personally.</p><br>
                    <p>Through my website, I aim to share my journey, insights, and projects with you. Whether you're here to learn more about my academic work, gaming experiences, or culinary adventures, I hope you find something that resonates with you. </p> <br>
                    <p>Thank you for visiting, and feel free to reach out if you'd like to connect! </p>
